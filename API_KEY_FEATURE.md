# ðŸ”‘ API Key Persistence Feature

## Overview
The Gemini API key is now automatically saved to the browser's localStorage, so users don't need to re-enter it every time they visit the application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Key Saving**
- When a user enters their API key, it's automatically saved to `localStorage`
- Key is stored under the name: `gemini_api_key`
- Saved locally in the browser - never sent to any server

### 2. **Automatic Key Loading**
- On app startup, checks for saved API key in localStorage
- If found, automatically initializes the Gemini service
- Falls back to environment variable if no saved key exists
- Priority order:
  1. localStorage (saved key)
  2. Environment variable (`.env` file)

### 3. **Change API Key Button**
- New "Change API Key" button in the header
- Clears the saved key from localStorage
- Returns user to API key input screen
- Also clears chat history and code

### 4. **Reset Chat Button**
- Renamed from "Reset" to "Reset Chat" for clarity
- Clears conversation history and code
- Does NOT clear the saved API key

### 5. **User Feedback**
- Added note on input screen: "ðŸ”’ Your API key will be saved locally in your browser"
- Clear indication that the key is stored securely

## Code Changes

### App.tsx
```typescript
// Check localStorage first, then environment variable
useEffect(() => {
  const savedApiKey = localStorage.getItem('gemini_api_key')
  if (savedApiKey) {
    setShowApiKeyInput(false)
    geminiServiceRef.current = new GeminiService(savedApiKey)
    return
  }
  // ... fall back to env variable
}, [])

// Save to localStorage when submitted
const handleApiKeySubmit = (key: string) => {
  localStorage.setItem('gemini_api_key', key)
  setShowApiKeyInput(false)
  geminiServiceRef.current = new GeminiService(key)
}
```

## Security Considerations

### âœ… Safe
- API key is stored in browser's localStorage
- Never transmitted to any third-party servers
- Only used to communicate directly with Google's Gemini API
- User has full control to change or remove the key

### ðŸ”’ Best Practices
- Key is stored as plain text in localStorage (standard practice for client-side apps)
- Users should only use this on trusted devices
- "Change API Key" button allows easy key rotation
- No server-side storage means no risk of database breaches

## User Experience

### First Visit
1. User sees API key input screen
2. Enters their Gemini API key
3. Sees note that key will be saved
4. Clicks "Start"
5. Key is saved and app loads

### Subsequent Visits
1. App automatically loads with saved key
2. No need to re-enter API key
3. User can immediately start creating models

### Changing Keys
1. Click "Change API Key" button in header
2. Returns to API key input screen
3. Enter new key
4. New key replaces old one in localStorage

## Testing Checklist

- [x] API key saves to localStorage on submit
- [x] API key loads from localStorage on app start
- [x] "Change API Key" button clears saved key
- [x] "Reset Chat" button preserves saved key
- [x] Environment variable still works as fallback
- [x] User sees confirmation that key will be saved
- [x] Build succeeds with no errors

## Browser Compatibility

localStorage is supported in all modern browsers:
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (all versions)
- âœ… Firefox (all versions)
- âœ… Safari (all versions)
- âœ… Opera (all versions)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Add encryption for stored API key
